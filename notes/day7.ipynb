    "# What this section is about and a simple trick\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This text explains a practical prompt engineering technique for ChatGPT: instructing the model to disregard prior conversation history within the same chat. This method allows users to reset the conversational context, enabling a clean start for new topics or tasks without opening a new chat window, which is beneficial for focused interactions and managing the model's token limit. This technique is valuable for users in various fields, including data science, who need to efficiently manage and pivot conversations with AI for tasks like scripting, brainstorming, or information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "* **Context Reset Command:** You can direct ChatGPT to ignore previous parts of a conversation in the current chat by using phrases like \"Disregard any formal directives\" or \"Forget everything from previous.\" This provides a simple yet effective way to start a new line of inquiry without interference from earlier exchanges.\n",
    "* **Clean Slate for New Prompts:** This technique essentially clears the AI's immediate focus on the preceding dialogue within that chat. It's particularly useful when shifting to a completely unrelated subject or when the existing context might confuse the AI or bias its responses for the new task.\n",
    "* **Token Limit Management:** By instructing ChatGPT to \"forget\" previous interactions, the context window for subsequent prompts is effectively renewed, meaning the token count for the new request isn't burdened by prior discussion. This is important because Large Language Models have a finite token limit, and this method helps ensure that new, relevant information is prioritized.\n",
    "* **Enhanced Interaction Flexibility:** This trick offers users greater control over the conversational flow within a single chat session. It allows for maintaining a record of diverse, unrelated queries or tasks in one place while ensuring that the AI treats each new segment independently, leading to more precise and relevant outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** Which specific project or task could benefit from this context-resetting technique? Provide a one-sentence explanation.\n",
    "    * *Answer: When using ChatGPT for drafting different sections of a data science report (e.g., methodology, then results, then discussion), this technique allows you to focus the AI on each section independently without carry-over from previous, potentially conflicting, instructions.*\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain this \"forget everything\" command to a junior colleague new to advanced ChatGPT usage? Keep it under two sentences.\n",
    "    * *Answer: You can tell your colleague, \"If you're in a long chat with ChatGPT and want to switch topics completely, just tell it 'Forget everything from previous.' This helps the AI give you fresh, focused answers for your new query without being influenced by what you talked about before.\"*\n",

    "# Semantic Prompting: My own way of prompt engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This text introduces a technique termed \"semantic prompting,\" designed to enhance ChatGPT's output by leveraging its understanding of semantic associations. Users provide a list of specific keywords or phrases relevant to their desired topic and style *before* the main instruction; this primes the AI to generate content that incorporates these terms and aligns with the implied context, as demonstrated by creating a fitness blog post about a \"perfect pull day for a wide back\" using terms like \"sarcoplasmic hypertrophy\" and \"progressive overload.\" This method offers an easy and effective way for users, including those in data science leveraging LLMs for text generation, to guide ChatGPT towards more specific, tailored, and stylistically appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "* **Semantic Prompting Defined:** This is a user-named technique where a list of specific keywords (e.g., \"sarcoplasmic hypertrophy,\" \"mechanical tension,\" \"pinwheel curls\") is provided to ChatGPT immediately before the main task prompt. The core idea is to trigger and guide the AI's semantic associations to shape the output.\n",
    "    * **Relevance:** This allows for more granular control over the AI's content generation, ensuring specific concepts or jargon are included and emphasized.\n",
    "* **Influencing Content and Style:** By \"seeding\" the prompt with carefully chosen terminology, users can direct ChatGPT to not only include these exact terms but also adopt a writing style, depth, or focus implicitly linked to them.\n",
    "    * **Real-world use:** Useful for generating specialized articles (like the fitness blog example), marketing copy aligned with brand voice, or technical explanations requiring precise terminology.\n",
    "* **Leveraging Semantic Association:** The technique relies on the LLM's ability to understand and connect concepts. The provided keywords act as anchors, helping the AI navigate its vast knowledge base to retrieve and generate text that is contextually aligned with these anchors.\n",
    "    * **Relevance:** Understanding this allows users to select keywords strategically to achieve desired nuances in the AI's output.\n",
    "* **Practical Example – Fitness Blog Post:** The presenter demonstrates by inputting terms like \"rec deadlifts,\" \"extreme stretches,\" and \"progressive overload,\" then asking for a blog post on structuring a \"pull day for a wide back.\" The AI-generated post naturally incorporated these terms and related concepts (e.g., rep ranges suitable for \"mechanical tension\").\n",
    "    * **How it can be used:** This approach can be adapted to any domain where specific vocabulary and concepts are key to the desired output, such as generating medical information, legal summaries, or even code with specific library mentions.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "* **Semantic Association in LLMs**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Semantic association is the cornerstone of how Large Language Models understand relationships between words, phrases, and concepts. They are trained on vast datasets to learn these connections, enabling them to comprehend context, infer meaning, and generate coherent, relevant text.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** This capability allows LLMs to perform diverse NLP tasks such as machine translation (understanding synonymy across languages), text summarization (identifying key concepts), sentiment analysis (recognizing emotional tone), and, as in this case, context-aware text generation. \"Semantic prompting\" directly exploits this by providing explicit semantic cues to guide the generation process for tasks like content creation or targeted information retrieval.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** To understand semantic association better, one might study:\n",
    "        * **Word Embeddings:** Techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText that represent words as vectors in a way that captures semantic relationships (e.g., \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" ≈ \"queen\").\n",
    "        * **Transformer Architecture:** The underlying architecture of models like ChatGPT, particularly the attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words when processing input and generating output.\n",
    "        * **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** The broader field concerned with how machines can be programmed to understand human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** Which specific dataset or project could benefit from this \"semantic prompting\" concept? Provide a one-sentence explanation.\n",
    "    * *Answer: Generating tailored Python code snippets for a data analysis tutorial could benefit, as providing keywords like \"pandas DataFrame,\" \"matplotlib scatter plot,\" and \"data cleaning\" before asking for code would ensure the output uses these specific libraries and addresses relevant concepts.*\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain \"semantic prompting\" to a junior colleague, using one concrete example? Keep the answer under two sentences.\n",
    "    * *Answer: To get a better recipe from ChatGPT, you'd first list key ingredients or cooking styles you prefer, like \"vegan, gluten-free, quick prep, spicy.\" This \"semantic prompting\" helps the AI focus on those specific aspects when it generates the recipe for you.*\n",

    "# Ask ChatGPT if you don't know how to prompt it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This text explains a meta-prompting strategy where users can ask ChatGPT for guidance on how to best structure their questions to receive optimal answers, especially when they are unsure. By providing initial, unstructured information about their situation (e.g., a person weighing 59kg wanting to lose 2kg, training twice a week), the user can prompt ChatGPT to suggest specific questions and information categories needed, effectively turning the AI into a collaborative partner for refining queries. This approach is useful for obtaining more comprehensive and tailored advice, particularly for multi-faceted topics like fitness, while also reminding users of the AI's limitations and the need for professional consultation in critical areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "* **Meta-Prompting for Query Formulation:** Users uncertain about how to effectively prompt ChatGPT can ask it directly for help by stating their general goal and then asking, \"What question should I ask you?\" or \"How should I structure the prompt?\"\n",
    "    * **Relevance:** This empowers users to leverage ChatGPT's own capabilities to improve their interaction quality, making it easier to elicit detailed and relevant responses without prior prompt engineering expertise.\n",
    "* **Iterative Refinement of Information:** ChatGPT can analyze a user's initial, often vague, input and respond by outlining specific categories of information it needs to provide a better answer (e.g., for fitness advice: dietary habits, detailed exercise routine, lifestyle factors, specific goals, health considerations).\n",
    "    * **Real-world use:** This is beneficial for complex problem-solving in data science, where defining the full scope of necessary input variables for a model or analysis might not be immediately obvious.\n",
    "* **ChatGPT as a Prompt Structuring Assistant:** This technique effectively transforms ChatGPT into an interactive guide that helps users break down their needs and articulate them in a way the AI can better process.\n",
    "    * **How it can be used:** A data analyst could describe a dataset and a business goal, then ask ChatGPT what specific analytical questions they should pose to the AI to get actionable insights or relevant code snippets.\n",
    "* **Practical Example – Fitness Inquiry:** The video shows a user providing basic personal fitness details and asking for guidance on what to ask. ChatGPT responds by listing key areas to elaborate on, enabling the user to then provide these richer details for a more tailored (though still general) response.\n",
    "    * **Relevance:** This demonstrates how to move from a poorly-defined query to a well-structured one, increasing the utility of the AI's output significantly.\n",
    "* **AI's Advisory Role and Disclaimers:** The interaction also highlights that ChatGPT often includes disclaimers, especially for sensitive topics like personalized health and fitness, advising users to consult human professionals for definitive advice.\n",

    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Large Language Models generate more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive outputs when given well-structured, detailed, and unambiguous prompts. Clear input provides better context, reducing the chances of the LLM misinterpreting the user's intent or generating generic, less useful information.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** In data science, effectively prompting an LLM for tasks like code generation, debugging assistance, literature review, or explanation of complex algorithms requires providing clear context about the programming language, data structures, specific errors, or the depth of explanation needed. This meta-prompting technique helps users learn what constitutes a \"well-structured\" prompt for their unique problem by getting direct feedback from the LLM.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Understanding this meta-prompting approach complements other prompt engineering strategies such as:\n",
    "        * **Few-shot prompting:** Providing examples within the prompt to guide the AI's response format and content.\n",
    "        * **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting:** Instructing the AI to outline its reasoning steps before giving a final answer, which often improves accuracy for complex tasks.\n",
    "        * **Persona-based prompting:** Assigning a role or persona to the AI (e.g., \"You are an expert Python programmer\") to tailor its responses.\n",
    "        This meta-prompting technique can be seen as a preliminary step to identify which details are crucial before applying other advanced prompting methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** In what data science scenario could asking ChatGPT \"how to ask\" be particularly beneficial? Provide a one-sentence explanation.\n",
    "    * *Answer: When tasked with exploring a new, unfamiliar dataset for a machine learning project, asking ChatGPT how to frame questions about potential features, necessary preprocessing steps, or suitable model types based on a data dictionary would help structure the initial analytical approach effectively.*\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain this meta-prompting technique to a non-technical user who struggles to get good answers from ChatGPT? Keep it under two sentences.\n",
    "    * *Answer: If you're not getting what you want from ChatGPT, just describe your overall situation and then ask it, \"What details should I tell you so you can help me best with this?\" ChatGPT will then list the types of information you should provide to get a much better and more specific answer.*\n",

    "# Reverse Prompt Engineering and the \"OK\" Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This video introduces Reverse Prompt Engineering (RPE), a technique to deconstruct an existing text to generate a prompt that can produce similar texts using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. It presents a structured four-step formula for RPE, emphasizing token efficiency and context setting, which is highly relevant for data scientists and AI practitioners looking to automate or replicate specific textual styles and content for tasks like report generation, content creation, or code documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Reverse Prompt Engineering (RPE) Defined:** RPE is the process of analyzing a given piece of text to create a detailed prompt that instructs an LLM to generate new text matching the original's style, content, meaning, language, and overall feel. This is useful for replicating effective communication styles or content structures without starting from scratch.\n",
    "-   **Four-Step RPE Formula:** A systematic approach to guide an LLM towards effective RPE:\n",
    "    1.  **Role & Context Priming:** Assign a role to the LLM (e.g., \"prompt engineering pro\"), define RPE, instruct it to think step-by-step, and use token-saving replies like \"Okay.\" This sets a clear context and operational mode.\n",
    "    2.  **Example Request:** Ask the LLM for an example of RPE. This helps the LLM solidify its understanding and provides a reference for its semantic association.\n",
    "    3.  **Technical Template Creation:** Request the LLM to create a technical template for RPE, encouraging it to ask clarifying questions. This builds a deeper, more structured knowledge base within the LLM for the task.\n",
    "    4.  **Application to Target Text:** Provide the specific text to be reverse-engineered, instructing the LLM to capture all its essential characteristics in the generated prompt. This is the core step where the desired prompt is created.\n",
    "-   **Token Optimization Strategy:** The technique of instructing the LLM to \"please only reply with okay\" (or similar brief affirmations) during initial setup phases significantly reduces token consumption. This is crucial for managing costs, staying within context window limits, especially with models like GPT-3.5, and ensuring important tokens are reserved for the main task.\n",
    "-   **Importance of Step-by-Step Thinking:** Instructing the LLM to \"think step by step\" leverages a Chain-of-Thought-like process, improving the quality and relevance of its responses, particularly for complex tasks like RPE.\n",
    "-   **Practical Application Example:** The video demonstrates RPE by taking an existing Amazon product description for towels and generating a prompt that can create similarly effective descriptions for other products. This showcases RPE's utility in e-commerce and marketing content generation.\n",
    "-   **Comparison with Shot Prompting:** While \"shot prompting\" (providing examples directly and asking for similar output) is simpler, RPE offers a more structured and potentially more accurate method for replicating nuanced text characteristics.\n",
    "-   **Output of RPE:** The process typically yields an analysis of the input text (covering content, style, language, purpose) and the reverse-engineered prompt itself, which can then be used to generate new, similar content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Token Optimization (e.g., \"Answer only with okay\")**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** LLMs have context window limits and token-based pricing. Unnecessary verbosity from the LLM in preliminary steps consumes valuable tokens that could be used for the core task or subsequent turns in the conversation, potentially leading to truncated inputs or higher costs.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** In iterative development of prompts, chatbots, or any LLM-driven application, minimizing token usage per interaction makes the system more efficient, responsive, and cost-effective. This is especially critical in production environments or when using less advanced models with smaller context windows.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Context window management, prompt chaining, efficient data representation for LLM input, and cost analysis of LLM API usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Staged Context Building for LLMs (The Four-Step RPE Approach)**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** LLMs perform better on complex tasks when context is built gradually and explicitly. Each step in the described RPE process (role-setting, example generation, template creation, application) serves to progressively focus the LLM's \"attention\" and \"understanding\" on the specific requirements of reverse prompt engineering.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** This mirrors how humans learn or tackle complex problems – by breaking them down and gathering information sequentially. In data science, this could be analogous to a multi-stage data processing pipeline or a phased approach to model building, where each stage prepares data or state for the next. It's crucial for tasks requiring nuanced understanding or generation.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, meta-prompting, instructional fine-tuning, and general strategies for guiding LLM behavior through structured dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Examples\n",
    "The video describes a sequence of prompts to be used with an LLM like ChatGPT. These are not programming code but rather instructional text inputs for the LLM:\n",

    "\n",
    "3.  **Technical Template Request Prompt:**\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    I would like you to create a technical template for reverse prompt engineering. Do not hesitate to ask questions if you need more context.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **RPE Application Prompt:**\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    I would ask you to apply reverse prompt engineering to the following text. Make sure to capture the writing style, content, meaning, language, and overall feel of the text in the prompt you create.\n",
    "    [Your Text Here]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    *(Replace \"[Your Text Here]\" with the actual text you want to reverse engineer.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** Which specific dataset or project could benefit from this Reverse Prompt Engineering concept? Provide a one-sentence explanation.\n",
    "    -   *Answer: A project involving the generation of consistent medical patient summaries from verbose clinical notes could benefit from RPE by first reverse-engineering well-written existing summaries to create a template prompt, ensuring uniformity and completeness in new summaries.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain Reverse Prompt Engineering to a junior colleague, using one concrete example? Keep the answer under two sentences.\n",
    "    -   *Answer: Imagine you love how a certain blog explains complex code; RPE is like figuring out the recipe (the prompt) that blog uses so you can write new explanations in that same clear and engaging style for your own documentation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Extension:** What related technique or area should you explore next, and why?\n",
    "    -   *Answer: Exploring few-shot or zero-shot prompting with very specific style instructions could be a valuable next step, as it might offer a quicker, albeit potentially less precise, way to achieve similar text style replication without the multi-step RPE process, useful for rapid prototyping.*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sequence prompting, Brackets and quotation marks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This video explains how to improve interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT by using sequence prompting, quotation marks, and brackets. These techniques help structure instructions for multi-step tasks, enhance clarity for the LLM, and organize the overall workflow, which is valuable for data scientists performing iterative text analysis, refinement, or generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Sequence Prompting:** This technique involves guiding an LLM through a series of steps or instructions across multiple interactions to achieve a complex goal. It allows users to break down a task, provide information incrementally, and receive staged outputs, leading to more controlled and refined results. For example, one can first instruct the LLM on how to process upcoming text, then provide the text, and finally select from LLM-generated options for further action.\n",
    "-   **Using Quotation Marks for Specific Directives:** Enclosing specific instructions or desired literal responses in quotation marks (e.g., \"Respond only with 'okay'\") helps ensure the LLM adheres strictly to those directives. This is particularly useful for controlling the LLM's verbosity or response format in initial setup phases of a sequence.\n",
    "-   **Using Brackets for Scoping and Organization:** Employing brackets (e.g., `[text]`, `(text)`, `{text}`) to clearly demarcate specific pieces of information or variables within a prompt helps the LLM identify and process these segments correctly. This improves the organization of complex prompts and aids the LLM in understanding the role of different input parts, much like how brackets function in mathematics.\n",
    "-   **Improved LLM Comprehension and Task Execution:** The combined use of sequence prompting, quotation marks, and brackets leads to more structured prompts, which significantly enhances the LLM's ability to understand and execute instructions accurately. This is crucial for data science tasks involving text manipulation, where precision in instruction can greatly affect the output.\n",
    "-   **Workflow Efficiency:** Sequence prompting allows for a more organized and iterative workflow. Users can define a process, feed data, review intermediate results (like a table of suggested improvements), and then direct the LLM to perform specific actions based on those results (e.g., \"use number 1\" from the table), saving time and streamlining complex text-based projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Sequence Prompting and Structured Interaction**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Many data science tasks involving text are not monolithic; they require iterative refinement or a series of transformations. Sequence prompting allows the user to guide the LLM through these stages logically, rather than trying to achieve everything in a single, overly complex prompt. This mimics a natural conversational or problem-solving flow.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** This is directly applicable to tasks like iterative data cleaning based on LLM suggestions, multi-stage report generation where sections are built upon LLM-generated drafts, or interactive data exploration where the LLM provides options and the user selects paths for deeper analysis. For instance, improving a technical document by first getting suggestions, then choosing which ones to apply.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, multi-turn dialogue management, stateful interaction with LLMs, and frameworks for building LLM-powered applications (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex) that formalize such sequences.\n",

    "-   **Delimiters (Quotation Marks and Brackets) for Clarity**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** LLMs process natural language, but clear structural cues help them disambiguate instructions from content, or one piece of data from another. Delimiters act as signposts, reducing ambiguity and improving the precision of the LLM's interpretation of the user's intent.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** When programmatically generating prompts or when prompts involve multiple distinct pieces of information (e.g., a text to summarize, a specific style to adopt, a list of keywords to include), delimiters ensure each component is correctly identified by the LLM. This is vital for automated report generation, batch text processing, or any system where prompts are constructed dynamically.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Prompt engineering best practices, input formatting for LLMs, developing clear and unambiguous instructions, and error analysis in LLM outputs to identify where lack of clarity might be an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Examples\n",
    "The video describes a sequence of prompts for an LLM. These are instructional texts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initial Instruction Prompt:**\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    Instruction:\n",
    "    I have a text that I want to improve.\n",
    "    Create a table with eight possible improvements for the text.\n",
    "    After the table, ask me the question \"Which improvements would you like to apply for the text? Choose items from the table.\"\n",
    "    Respond only with \"okay\" because I will give you the text after that.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Text Input Prompt (following the LLM's \"okay\"):**\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    text: [Paste your text here]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    *(Example text provided in video: \"How to train your biceps...\")*\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Selection Prompt (after LLM provides the table and asks the question):**\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    use number 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    *(Or any other number from the LLM-generated table of improvements.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** Which specific dataset or project could benefit from using sequence prompting with clear delimiters? Provide a one-sentence explanation.\n",
    "    -   *Answer: A project requiring the summarization and keyword tagging of diverse research papers could use sequence prompting to first get a summary, then ask for keyword suggestions based on that summary, and finally request a revised summary incorporating selected keywords, using brackets to clearly separate the paper's content from instructions at each stage.*\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain the benefit of using brackets like `[text]` in a prompt to a junior colleague? Keep the answer under two sentences.\n",
    "    -   *Answer: Using brackets like `[text]` tells the AI \"this specific part is the main content I want you to focus on or modify,\" making your instructions clearer and preventing the AI from getting confused by other parts of your prompt.*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Brackets, quotation marks, and shortcuts clarification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This video provides quick tips on effectively using brackets, quotation marks, and common shortcuts when interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. It clarifies the order of execution for different types of brackets, demonstrates how quotation marks aid in specifying text for tasks like translation, and shows that LLMs recognize shortcuts like \"TLDR\" for summarization, all of which are practical for data scientists seeking to streamline their prompting workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Bracket Execution Order:** When using nested brackets in prompts, LLMs like ChatGPT process them in a specific order, similar to mathematical conventions: 1st Parentheses `()`, 2nd Braces `{}`, and 3rd Square Brackets `[]`. Using a single type of bracket is fine, but if nesting, this order matters for how the prompt is parsed. This understanding is crucial for constructing complex, layered instructions.\n",
    "-   **Quotation Marks for Clarity:** Using quotation marks (e.g., `\"text to process\"`) is highly recommended to clearly delineate the specific text segment an LLM should operate on, especially for tasks like translation or summarization when the surrounding prompt might contain other instructions. For example, `Translate in German: \"This is the text.\"` helps the LLM isolate the exact content for translation.\n",
    "-   **LLM Understanding of Shortcuts:** ChatGPT and similar LLMs are trained on vast datasets that include common internet slang and shortcuts. Users can leverage this by using abbreviations like \"TLDR\" (Too Long; Didn't Read) or phrases like \"too long dear read\" to request summaries, making interactions quicker and more intuitive than typing full sentences.\n",
    "-   **Practical Application in Translation:** A demonstrated use case for quotation marks is in translation. By formatting a prompt as `Translate in [Target Language]: \"[Text to Translate]\"`, users can ensure the LLM accurately identifies and translates the intended passage, even if the prompt contains other contextual information.\n",
    "-   **Efficiency in Prompting:** Understanding and utilizing these elements (bracket hierarchy, purposeful quotation, common shortcuts) allows for more efficient, precise, and organized communication with LLMs. This saves time and can lead to more accurate and desired outputs, which is beneficial for data scientists who often iterate on text-based data or instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Bracket Processing Hierarchy**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** In complex prompts where instructions or data might be nested or grouped, a defined processing order for brackets ensures that the LLM interprets the user's intended structure correctly. This is analogous to order of operations in arithmetic ($PEMDAS/BODMAS$) and helps in disambiguating complex instructions.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** For data scientists building intricate prompts that might involve defining parameters within parameters, or specifying data subsets within larger instructions, understanding this hierarchy allows for predictable parsing by the LLM, leading to more reliable outcomes in tasks like conditional text generation or structured data extraction.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Formal language theory, parser design (at a conceptual level), and advanced prompt engineering techniques involving structured data representation within prompts (e.g., pseudo-code or JSON-like structures).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **LLM Recognition of Informal Shortcuts (e.g., TLDR)**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** LLMs are trained on diverse internet text, including informal language. Their ability to understand common shortcuts like \"TLDR\" makes them more user-friendly and allows for quicker interactions, reflecting a more natural, human-like communication style.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** In rapid information retrieval or when quickly summarizing text is needed, using \"TLDR\" is faster than typing \"Please summarize the following text concisely.\" This is useful for data scientists quickly sifting through documents or generating brief overviews of analytical findings.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities of LLMs, the impact of training data diversity on LLM behavior, and the field of \"instruction fine-tuning\" which optimizes LLMs to follow user commands, including informal ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Examples\n",
    "The video describes prompt structures and examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Bracket Types and Names:**\n",
    "    -   Parentheses: `()`\n",
    "    -   Braces: `{}`\n",
    "    -   Square Brackets: `[]`\n",
    "    -   Order of execution (if nested): `( { [ ] } )`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Using Quotation Marks for Translation:**\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    Translate in German: \"I have a text and so on.\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Using Shortcuts for Summarization (TLDR):**\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    TLDR: \"[Paste your long text here]\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    or\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    too long dear read: \"[Paste your long text here]\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** Which specific dataset or project could benefit from using the \"TLDR\" shortcut with an LLM? Provide a one-sentence explanation.\n",
    "    -   *Answer: A project involving daily aggregation of numerous lengthy news articles on financial markets could use \"TLDR\" to quickly generate executive summaries for each article, enabling faster trend identification.*\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain the bracket execution order `( { [ ] } )` to a junior colleague using a simple analogy? Keep the answer under two sentences.\n",
    "    -   *Answer: Think of it like nested boxes; the LLM first opens the innermost box (square brackets), then the one around it (braces), and finally the outermost box (parentheses) to understand your instructions layer by layer.*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using Self-Criticism To Improve ChatGPT Output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This video demonstrates a technique where ChatGPT is prompted to critique its own output, enabling iterative improvement of generated content. By using a sequence of prompts that first assign a content generation role and then a separate analytical \"critique\" role, users can elicit constructive feedback from the LLM on its initial text, which can then be used to refine the output further, a valuable method for data scientists aiming for high-quality textual results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Self-Critique for Improvement:** The core technique involves making ChatGPT generate content and then, in a subsequent step, act as a \"critique\" to analyze that same content and suggest improvements. This leverages the LLM's analytical capabilities to enhance its own creative output.\n",
    "-   **Sequence Prompting for Staged Interaction:** The process uses a sequence of prompts:\n",
    "    1.  **Content Generation:** Assign an expert role (e.g., \"financial analyst\") and provide context (e.g., famous investors) to generate an initial piece of text.\n",
    "    2.  **Critique Role Assignment:** Instruct ChatGPT to adopt an analytical persona (e.g., \"You act as a critique. You are analytic.\") and to reply \"okay\" to confirm.\n",
    "    3.  **Request for Analysis:** Provide the LLM's own generated text and ask how it can be improved.\n",
    "-   **Iterative Refinement Potential:** After receiving the critique (e.g., suggestions to be more concise, add examples, address risks), the user can instruct the LLM to apply specific suggestions to the original text, leading to a more polished and effective final product. This iterative loop is key to leveraging the self-critique.\n",
    "-   **Role-Playing for Context:** Assigning specific roles (like \"Wall Street expert\" or \"critique\") helps focus the LLM's output for both the initial generation and the subsequent analysis, tailoring its responses to the desired context and style.\n",
    "-   **Semantic Association:** Using relevant keywords and names (e.g., \"Peter Lynch,\" \"Warren Buffett\") during the initial content generation prompt helps guide the LLM towards a specific domain and tone, enriching the initial output before critique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **LLM Self-Critique and Persona Shifting**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** LLMs can generate diverse text but may not always achieve optimal quality, clarity, or completeness in the first attempt. By prompting an LLM to switch to an analytical or critical persona, it can apply a different set of evaluation criteria to its own output, identifying weaknesses it might not have avoided during initial generation.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** This is highly relevant for data scientists and professionals drafting reports, creating documentation, or generating any textual content that requires accuracy and refinement. For example, an LLM could draft an initial analysis of a dataset, then critique its own draft for clarity, potential biases, or missing interpretations before a human review.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Iterative prompting, red teaming (where AI is used to find flaws in AI systems), constitutional AI (where AI systems are guided by a set of principles to self-correct), and multi-persona prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Iterative Improvement Loop**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Complex content creation often benefits from multiple passes and refinements. The self-critique mechanism allows for a structured iterative loop (generate -> critique -> revise) entirely within the LLM interaction, enabling progressive quality enhancement.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real‑world tasks, problems, or applications?** In software development, this mirrors agile sprints or code reviews. For data analysis, it's like progressively refining a model or a visualization based on initial findings and critiques. It allows for a more dynamic and responsive content generation process.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), prompt chaining for multi-step tasks, and general principles of iterative design and quality assurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Examples\n",
    "The video describes a sequence of prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initial Content Generation Prompt:**\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    You are a financial analyst and Wall Street expert. [Mention other experts/concepts for semantic association, e.g., Peter Lynch, Warren Buffett, Rich dad, poor dad]. Write a small article how I can invest $10,000.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Critique Role Setup Prompt:**\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    You act as a critique. You are analytic. Answer only with okay.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Critique Request Prompt (after LLM responds with \"okay\"):**\n",
    "    ```text\n",
    "    Analyze this text. How can I improve it?\n",
    "    [Paste the article generated by ChatGPT in step 1 here]\n",

    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** Which specific dataset or project could benefit from this LLM self-critique technique? Provide a one-sentence explanation.\n",
    "    -   *Answer: A project involving the generation of complex technical documentation for a new software API could use self-critique to ensure the initial draft is then reviewed by the LLM for clarity, completeness of examples, and accuracy before human editing.*\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain the concept of LLM self-critique to a junior colleague, using one concrete example? Keep it under two sentences.\n",
