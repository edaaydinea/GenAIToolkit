## Week 1 - AI Fundamentals, ChatGPT, and the Future of General AI

### Day 1: AI Fundamentals and Introduction to Large Language Models

**What I did today:**

- Introduced fundamental concepts such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL), and explained the relationships between them.
- Discussed what Large Language Models (LLMs - e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama) are, how they are trained, and their basic working principles.
- Explained the concept of "tokens" used by LLMs to process text and the "token limit" (context window) that models possess.
- Examined how Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enhances the performance of LLMs and their alignment with human expectations.
- Compared the fundamental differences between Large Language Models and traditional search engines like Google in terms of interaction styles and output types.

### Day 3: ChatGPT, Free vs. Paid Features, and the Evolving LLM Landscape

**What I did today:**

- Explored the rapid pace of AI advancements, including frequent updates to models like GPT-4o (Omni) and how these changes impact feature accessibility (e.g., previously paid features becoming free).
- Learned how to create a ChatGPT account, navigate the web interface, and manage settings such as chat history, data controls, and beta features, with a focus on privacy considerations for data science work.
- Compared the free (GPT-3.5) and paid (GPT-4) versions of ChatGPT, highlighting differences in capabilities, access to advanced features (like DALL-E 3, web browsing, Advanced Data Analysis), and practical implications for data scientists.
- Examined the core outputs of LLMs—text, tables, and code—and discussed how prompt engineering can enhance these outputs for data science tasks.
- Investigated new features such as ChatGPT Search, Canvas for interactive editing, and the introduction of "o1 Preview/Mini" models for advanced reasoning (System 2 thinking).
- Reflected on the fundamental operations of LLMs (summarization and expansion) and the integration of multimodal capabilities (text, vision, audio) in the latest models.

### Day 4: The History and Future of AI—From Turing Test to Foundation Agents

**What I did today:**

- Reviewed the historical evolution of AI, from early concepts like the Turing Test to landmark achievements such as AlphaGo by DeepMind.
- Reflected on the importance of active learning and hands-on engagement with AI tools, emphasizing the value of creating a ChatGPT account and experimenting with prompts as a foundation for mastering prompt engineering.
- Explored the reasons behind the current AI hype, including the roles of machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks in driving recent breakthroughs.
- Summarized Nvidia's vision for the future of AI, focusing on the development of general-purpose "Foundation Agents" capable of mastering diverse skills, embodiments, and realities, as presented in Jim Fan's TED Talk.
- Examined key Nvidia projects such as Project Voyager (autonomous skill learning in Minecraft via LLM-generated code), Project Metamorph (generalized robot control), and Isaac Sim (advanced simulation for AI training and Sim2Real transfer).
- Considered the broader implications of general AI agents, including lifelong learning, coding as action, and the ethical and societal impacts of deploying highly capable autonomous systems.

## Week 2 - Mastering Prompt Engineering for Enhanced LLM Interaction

### Day 5: Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering: Context, Structure, and Advanced Techniques

**What I did today:**

- Understood the critical importance of prompt engineering for obtaining accurate and relevant answers from LLMs, recognizing that LLMs require specific guidance to emulate human-like reasoning.
- Explored the concept of semantic association as the cornerstone of effective prompt engineering, learning how LLMs link words to networks of related concepts and how specificity in prompts refines these associations.
- Differentiated between effective and "bad" prompts, emphasizing that prompts lacking context, specificity, and clear goals lead to generic outputs, and highlighted the necessity of domain knowledge for evaluating LLM responses.
- Learned practical techniques to improve prompts, such as providing detailed context (Tip #1), using structured prompts (Modifier, Topic, Additional Modifiers like target audience), and employing instruction prompting.
- Investigated advanced prompting strategies including role prompting (assigning a persona to the LLM), shot prompting (zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot examples), and the use of seemingly counter-intuitive phrases ("Let's think step by step," "Take a deep breath") to enhance output quality.
- Recognized the power of combining these various prompting techniques to create sophisticated, layered instructions that elicit superior and highly tailored outputs from LLMs.

### Day 6: Optimizing RAG Applications - Data Preparation, Chunking, and Tools

**What I did today:**

- Understood that high-quality, well-structured data is crucial for effective Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, and that real-world data (PDFs, websites) often requires significant preprocessing.
- Explored tools for converting unstructured data into LLM-friendly markdown: Firecrawl for extracting content from websites and LlamaParse (from LlamaIndex) for processing local files like PDFs, CSVs, and Word documents.
- Learned about the LlamaParse web interface on LlamaCloud for easier, no-code PDF-to-markdown conversion.
- Investigated the importance of chunk size and chunk overlap in RAG, understanding how these parameters affect retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding by addressing issues like LLM's "lost in the middle" problem and maintaining semantic continuity.
- Reviewed general guidelines for setting chunk size based on content type (long-form narratives, general documents, lists) and chunk overlap (typically 1-5% of chunk size), emphasizing the necessity of experimentation for optimal results.
