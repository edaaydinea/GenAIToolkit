# All of AI: ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion & App Dev

This extensive AI course offers a comprehensive curriculum, guiding learners from foundational AI principles (machine learning, deep learning, LLMs, tokens) through advanced prompt engineering, and into a wide array of practical applications using tools like ChatGPT. It covers generative AI for images and video (Dall-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Adobe Firefly), custom GPT and chatbot development, programming with AI assistance, exploring the LLM market beyond ChatGPT, and concludes with monetization strategies, ethical considerations, and the future of AI.

## Week 1 - AI Fundamentals, ChatGPT, and the Evolving LLM Landscape

### Day 1: AI Fundamentals and Introduction to Large Language Models

**What I did today:**

- Introduced fundamental concepts such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL), and explained the relationships between them.
- Discussed what Large Language Models (LLMs - e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama) are, how they are trained, and their basic working principles.
- Explained the concept of "tokens" used by LLMs to process text and the "token limit" (context window) that models possess.
- Examined how Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enhances the performance of LLMs and their alignment with human expectations.
- Compared the fundamental differences between Large Language Models and traditional search engines like Google in terms of interaction styles and output types.

### Day 2: Course Overview, Goals, and Important Resources

**What I did today:**

- Reviewed the overall structure of the course, its modules, and learning objectives in detail.
- Shared the instructor's primary goals for the course, the competencies intended for students to acquire, and tips for an effective learning process.
- Presented a list of essential tools, platforms (ChatGPT, Replit, Hugging Face, etc.) to be used throughout the course, and important online resources for reference.
- Provided a general introduction to the main topics to be covered in later stages of the course, such as prompt engineering, generative AI (image, video creation), custom GPTs, and chatbot development.
- Emphasized that the course will also cover ethical considerations and the future of AI.

### Day 3: ChatGPT, Free vs. Paid Features, and the Evolving LLM Landscape

**What I did today:**

- Explored the rapid pace of AI advancements, including frequent updates to models like GPT-4o (Omni) and how these changes impact feature accessibility (e.g., previously paid features becoming free).
- Learned how to create a ChatGPT account, navigate the web interface, and manage settings such as chat history, data controls, and beta features, with a focus on privacy considerations for data science work.
- Compared the free (GPT-3.5) and paid (GPT-4) versions of ChatGPT, highlighting differences in capabilities, access to advanced features (like DALL-E 3, web browsing, Advanced Data Analysis), and practical implications for data scientists.
- Examined the core outputs of LLMs—text, tables, and code—and discussed how prompt engineering can enhance these outputs for data science tasks.
- Investigated new features such as ChatGPT Search, Canvas for interactive editing, and the introduction of "o1 Preview/Mini" models for advanced reasoning (System 2 thinking).
- Reflected on the fundamental operations of LLMs (summarization and expansion) and the integration of multimodal capabilities (text, vision, audio) in the latest models.
