# All of AI: ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion & App Dev

This extensive AI course offers a comprehensive curriculum, guiding learners from foundational AI principles (machine learning, deep learning, LLMs, tokens) through advanced prompt engineering, and into a wide array of practical applications using tools like ChatGPT. It covers generative AI for images and video (Dall-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Adobe Firefly), custom GPT and chatbot development, programming with AI assistance, exploring the LLM market beyond ChatGPT, and concludes with monetization strategies, ethical considerations, and the future of AI.

## Week 1 - AI Fundamentals and Course Introduction

### Day 1: AI Fundamentals and Introduction to Large Language Models

**What I did today:**

- Introduced fundamental concepts such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL), and explained the relationships between them.
- Discussed what Large Language Models (LLMs - e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama) are, how they are trained, and their basic working principles.
- Explained the concept of "tokens" used by LLMs to process text and the "token limit" (context window) that models possess.
- Examined how Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enhances the performance of LLMs and their alignment with human expectations.
- Compared the fundamental differences between Large Language Models and traditional search engines like Google in terms of interaction styles and output types.

### Day 2: Course Overview, Goals, and Important Resources

**What I did today:**

- Reviewed the overall structure of the course, its modules, and learning objectives in detail.
- Shared the instructor's primary goals for the course, the competencies intended for students to acquire, and tips for an effective learning process.
- Presented a list of essential tools, platforms (ChatGPT, Replit, Hugging Face, etc.) to be used throughout the course, and important online resources for reference.
- Provided a general introduction to the main topics to be covered in later stages of the course, such as prompt engineering, generative AI (image, video creation), custom GPTs, and chatbot development.
- Emphasized that the course will also cover ethical considerations and the future of AI.
