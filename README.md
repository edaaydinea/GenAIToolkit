## Week 2 - Advanced Prompt Engineering, RAG, and Prompt Generation Strategies

### Day 5: Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering: Context, Structure, and Advanced Techniques

**What I did today:**

- Understood the critical importance of prompt engineering for obtaining accurate and relevant answers from LLMs, recognizing that LLMs require specific guidance to emulate human-like reasoning.
- Explored the concept of semantic association as the cornerstone of effective prompt engineering, learning how LLMs link words to networks of related concepts and how specificity in prompts refines these associations.
- Differentiated between effective and "bad" prompts, emphasizing that prompts lacking context, specificity, and clear goals lead to generic outputs, and highlighted the necessity of domain knowledge for evaluating LLM responses.
- Learned practical techniques to improve prompts, such as providing detailed context (Tip #1), using structured prompts (Modifier, Topic, Additional Modifiers like target audience), and employing instruction prompting.
- Investigated advanced prompting strategies including role prompting (assigning a persona to the LLM), shot prompting (zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot examples), and the use of seemingly counter-intuitive phrases ("Let's think step by step," "Take a deep breath") to enhance output quality.
- Recognized the power of combining these various prompting techniques to create sophisticated, layered instructions that elicit superior and highly tailored outputs from LLMs.

### Day 6: Optimizing RAG Applications - Data Preparation, Chunking, and Tools

**What I did today:**

- Understood that high-quality, well-structured data is crucial for effective Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, and that real-world data (PDFs, websites) often requires significant preprocessing.
- Explored tools for converting unstructured data into LLM-friendly markdown: Firecrawl for extracting content from websites and LlamaParse (from LlamaIndex) for processing local files like PDFs, CSVs, and Word documents.
- Learned about the LlamaParse web interface on LlamaCloud for easier, no-code PDF-to-markdown conversion.
- Investigated the importance of chunk size and chunk overlap in RAG, understanding how these parameters affect retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding by addressing issues like LLM's "lost in the middle" problem and maintaining semantic continuity.
- Reviewed general guidelines for setting chunk size based on content type (long-form narratives, general documents, lists) and chunk overlap (typically 1-5% of chunk size), emphasizing the necessity of experimentation for optimal results.
